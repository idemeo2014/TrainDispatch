Train Project Log


Week 1
Today group members met during Lab for the first time.  Email list and google docs sharing folder was created.  Talked about how to create and run first prototype of train project.

Questions: Will methods be given for us to implement or will we create our own?

Week 2
Set up github repository
Link to webpage: https://github.com/cPolaris/TrainDispatch

Week 3
All group members meet to discuss logic for the train project and discussed how we are to program our trains.  Tasks were divided and preliminary code was written.

Week 4
Discussed what type of Data Structures we are going to use for the elevator project, such as different sort and search methods.

Week 5
No meeting due to schedule conflicts

Week 6
Reviewed each otherâ€™s preliminary code on the elevator code.

Week 7
No meeting due to schedule conflicts

Week 8
Began implementation of the stopwatch timer in order to track waiting time and total cost.  dealt with bugs involved with train paths connected while enroute.

Also began working on the dummy train system.

Week 9
No meeting but shared and reviewed code through github and emails.

Week 10
No meeting due to schedule conflicts

Week 11
Group met during lab to review code implementation and to discuss complexity. Suggested edit were given so that code could be more efficent.
In addition, used dummy elevator code and expanded it to hold multiple trains and larger, and longer routes.

Week 12
Group met in lab and discussed user interface.  Began to play around with different ideas for user interface. Decided on using pre-existing train lines in
Countries such as Japan, China, and the USA.

Week 13
Group met in lab and assigned final tasks to eachother: debugging, and GUI implementation

Week 14
Dijkstra's Algorithm was was corrected and implemented. For the GUI, plots were recorded and implemented for the train stations in China, Japan, and the USA.
