Your submission should then have 4 things (please ZIP in one file and submit it)

- Presentation in PDF (you're allowed to change it slightly after the submission)
- PDF of your report (as above, not changes allowed after the submission)
- All the source codes (program must compile when the GSAs run, so include extra libraries you may have used)
- I added a requirement for you to include a README.txt file to indicate to us how to run your project.

### The project will be graded based on 3 criteria (100 points total)

- Quality of your PDF report (25 points)
- Quality and delivery of your presentation (25 points)
- Code (50 points)

Here is a rough rubric for each of these parts:

###### PDF Report

- Description on how the system works (2 points)
- List of algorithms and data structures used (2 points)
- Weekly log (4 points)
- Performance Analysis (Charts). Comparison between your proposed approach and the base case (15 points). Include explanation of the charts. The charts alone are NOT sufficient.
- List of references (2 points)

###### Code

- Correct implementation of the base case (benchmark) (10 points)
- Correct implementation of an alternative solution (20 points)
- Graphical Interface (10 points)
- Other factors (10 points)

* Note that if your code does not compile and run you'll get a ZERO in this part.

###### Presentation

You should plan to talk for about 15 minutes. Avoid demo the code. Describe how the system works and present the statistical results. A typical presentation structure is: introduction to the problem, description of the solution implemented including motivation, results, demo of the execution.

- Description the Problem: 4 points
- Description of the Solution Implemented: 2 points
- Results and Demo of the execution: 10 points
- Ability to answer questions: 4 points
- Discretionary: 5 points

* Every group member should talk. If you do not talk you get a ZERO in this grade.
* If your group talks too much or too little you'll loose points.
* Make sure you come with a notebook ready with the presentation and with the demo. Your 15 minutes will start after I call your group. E.g. if you take 10 minutes to configure the computer you'll have only 5 minutes to present.
